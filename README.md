# AWS-Dangling-Domains
Dangling Domains in AWS script for exploitation

This was written by dafthack/aws-dangling-domain-discovery-tool.sh but was not working because BING updated its endpoints. 
+ I added some enhacements to the code. Like the last commented line, with that you can release your IPs manually if needed.
